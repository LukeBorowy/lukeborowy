### Dungeon Party
![Dungeon Party](/assets/img/dungeon_party.png)
Developed a capstone project along with two other group members from scratch. Dungeon Party is an web-based game where you can play together with a group of friends (up to 15 people), using mobile devices or a personal computer. Gameplay consists of 5 different minigames, which you complete with your team of 2-3 players as you try to win enough skill points to gain treasure in the overworld!
