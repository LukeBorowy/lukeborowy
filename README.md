Dungeon Party is an web-based game where you can play together with a group of friends (up to 15 people), using mobile devices or a personal computer. Gameplay consists of 5 different minigames, which you complete with your team of 2-3 players as you try to win enough skill points to gain treasure in the overworld! A Typescript frontend used Socket.io to communicate with the backend Node.js server.

Developed a Vue.js website to help a local Boy Scout troop conduct a months-long fundraising event. The system includes integration with 3 different payment options, as well as a admin dashboard for use when making reports and managing the sales. I used Node.js with a PostgreSQL database to store inventory and sale records.
