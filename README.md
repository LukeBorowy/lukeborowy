# About Me
Hi, I'm Luke Borowy! I've just completed my 3rd year of a degree in Computer Science from the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota. I enjoy playing board games, mountain biking, and reading good books.

I have been programming since I was in elementary school, and I have a passion for coding and developing software of all kinds! 

## Technical Skills
I have experience in several different programming languages, coming from career positions and personal projects. I know the following, roughly ordered from most to least knowledgeable:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- C++, C
- SQL
- C#

I also know how to work with several popular frameworks:
- Vue.js: From creating a sale tracking application (see below)
- Angular.js: From job experiencing working on a internal application
- .NET: From job experience working on expanding an API

## Soft Skills
- Leadership: I have led group projects in school, and I was the lead programmer on my high school robotics team.
- Commitment: Throughout my academic and personal lives, I have always pushed myself to achieve excellence in what I do.
- Self-motivation: Most of my programming knowledge and skill come from personal learning that I have done throughout my life.

## Notable Projects
### Dungeon Party

Dungeon Party is a web-based game where you can play together with a group of friends (up to 15 people), using mobile devices or a personal computer. Gameplay consists of 5 different minigames, which you complete with your team of 2-3 players as you try to win enough skill points to gain treasure in the overworld! A Typescript frontend uses Socket.io to communicate with the backend Node.js server. PixiJs is used to display graphics efficiently.
#### Contributions (worked with 2 other group members)
- Primary architect of game functionality and technology choice
- Programmer of all 5 minigames

#### Keywords: TypeScript, Web Development, Node.JS, Games, Mobile, Socket.io 

### Meatstick Sales App

I developed a Vue.js website to help a local Boy Scout troop conduct a months-long fundraising event. The system includes a mobile-focused flow for making sales along with integration with 3 different payment options. It also include an admin dashboard for leaders to use when making reports, transferring inventory, and managing the sales. I used Node.js with a PostgreSQL database to store inventory and sale records. 

#### Keywords: Vue.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, JavaScript

### FRC Robotics

I was on a high school robotics team for 4 years, and several other teams before that. I used Java to program the robot for real-time control, with my programming leading to an appearence in the MN State Championship 2 years in a row. I also used a Raspberry Pi to add computer vision capabilities to our robot.
#### Team contributions
- Lead programmer
- Primary electrician
- Assisted in robot design and construction

#### Keywords: Java, Robotics, Computer Vision

### Stikk.io
